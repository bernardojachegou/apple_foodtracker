View this set of incremental lessons as a guided introduction to building your first app‚Äîincluding the tools, major concepts, and best practices that will ease your path. </p>

<p> This is a simple meal-tracking app called FoodTracker. This app shows a list of meals, including a meal name, rating, and photo. A user can add, remove, or edit a meal. To add a new meal or edit an existing one, users navigate to a different screen where they can specify a name, rating, and photo for a particular meal.</p>
